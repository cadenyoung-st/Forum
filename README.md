# ITS AMS Community

The purpose of the ITS AMS Community is to connect key ITS stakeholders, AMS stakeholders, and U.S. DOT / FHWA to identify critical issues, focus resources and attention, and actively participate in ITS AMS program activities. To achieve a dynamic, self-sustaining, and engaged ITS AMS Community, we will initially establish a pilot community. This community will operate continuously and hold regular meetings to ensure the program effectively addresses the needs of key stakeholders
